# Sudoku on Arkworks from ZKP course

To be fair I'm not entirely sure this is what I want. If I understand this
correctly it just creates a constrain system and then provides inputs to satisfy
it, but it does not compute witnesses or circuits or proofs or anything.

It's probably better to actually look at the proper arkwors tutorial for r1cs
(the other directory)
